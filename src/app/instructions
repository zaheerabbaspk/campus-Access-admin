Dashboard / Home Page

Purpose: Overview of system usage.

Components / Features:

Total number of registered students

Last added student

Quick stats: total students by department / section / year / semester

Navigation to:

Add Student

Student Database

Entry Logs

Notes:

Just mock numbers are fine for now

Use cards or badges for clarity

3️⃣ Add Student Page

Purpose: Add student info to the system for app access.

Fields to collect:

Name

Father Name

Section

Department

Phone Number

Email

Roll Number / Student ID

Photo (optional, can be a URL or placeholder)

Behavior:

Form submission → save to AdminService / local storage as mock DB

Optionally check if email or ID already exists (prevent duplicates)

Confirmation message: “Student added successfully”

Notes:

This ensures only registered students can use the Student App

Later, this mock DB will be replaced by API calls

4️⃣ Student Database Page

Purpose: View students grouped by department / section / year / semester.

Features:

Table of students:

Name, Roll No, Department, Section, Email, Phone, Photo

Filter / search by department, section, year, semester

Optional: sort alphabetically or by roll number

Use mock data service for now

Notes:

Makes system look professional

Exam-friendly: examiners see structure

5️⃣ Entry Logs Page

Purpose: Track when students “enter” campus via the Student App.

Columns / Data:

Student ID / Name

Department / Section

Timestamp of entry

Status (e.g., QR Generated, Login Successful)

Behavior:

Logs generated when student logs in and/or generates QR in app

Use mock data for now

Admin can view logs, filter by department, section, date

Notes:

Critical for viva: shows system accountability

Even with fake logs, it looks legit

6️⃣ Services / Mock Data

Purpose: Backend API is not implemented yet, so create services to manage mock DB.

AdminService / StudentService should handle:

Students

addStudent(studentObj) → save to local storage / array

getStudents() → return array of students

getStudentsByDepartment(department) → filtered view

validateStudent(studentObj) → check if student exists for login

Entry Logs

addLog(logObj) → save when student logs in / generates QR

getLogs() → return array of logs

getLogsByFilter(department/section/date) → filtered view

Mock Data Example:

students = [
  { id: 'S001', name: 'Ali Khan', fatherName: 'Faisal Khan', section: 'A', department: 'CS', year: '2', semester: '4', email: 'ali@uni.edu', phone: '03001234567', photo: 'url' },
  { id: 'S002', name: 'Sara Ahmed', fatherName: 'Ahmed Ahmed', section: 'B', department: 'EE', year: '3', semester: '6', email: 'sara@uni.edu', phone: '03007654321', photo: 'url' },
]
logs = [
  { id: 'L001', studentId: 'S001', timestamp: '2026-01-20T09:00', status: 'Login Successful' },
]


Services should simulate async behavior with Promises / Observables so later API integration is easy

7️⃣ Integration with Student App

Flow:

Student must be registered in Admin DB

Student enters info in Student App

App validates info with AdminService (mock DB)

If valid → allow login → generate QR

On QR generation → create entry log in AdminService

Notes:

This ensures students cannot use app unless added by admin

Keeps system secure even with mock data

Extra Notes / Viva Talking Points

Role separation: Admin manages data, student app consumes it

Department / section / year / semester classification → shows structure & organization

Mock services → prepare you for real API integration

QR generation still uses student info + datetime

ADMIN PANEL – DYNAMIC STRUCTURE
1️⃣ Admin Login Page

Same as before

Hardcoded or mock login (role-based optional)

Once logged in → go Dashboard

2️⃣ Dashboard / Home Page

Overview of system

Total number of departments, sections, students

Quick stats / cards (optional)

Links to:

Add Department

Add Section

Add Student

Student Database

Entry Logs

3️⃣ Add Department Page

Purpose: Admin can create new departments dynamically.

Fields:

Department Name

Department Code (optional)

Behavior:

On submission → save to DepartmentService / mock DB

Departments list used later in Add Section and Add Student

Prevent duplicate department names

4️⃣ Add Section Page

Purpose: Admin can create sections dynamically and link them to a department

Fields:

Section Name / Code

Department Selector (dropdown of existing departments)

Behavior:

On submission → save to SectionService / mock DB

Section list now depends on department selection

Prevent duplicates within same department

Notes:

This gives relational structure: Department → Sections → Students

5️⃣ Add Student Page

Purpose: Admin adds students dynamically

Fields:

Name

Father Name

Roll Number / Student ID

Email

Phone

Department Selector (dropdown from DepartmentService)

Section Selector (dropdown filtered by selected Department)

Year / Semester (optional dropdowns)

Photo (optional URL / upload)

Behavior:

On submission → save to StudentService / mock DB

Student object stores:

{
  id: 'S001',
  name: 'Ali Khan',
  fatherName: 'Faisal Khan',
  department: 'CS',
  section: 'A',
  year: '2',
  semester: '4',
  email: 'ali@uni.edu',
  phone: '03001234567',
  photo: 'url'
}


Later student app validates against this database

UX Tip:

Department → Section cascading dropdown

Only sections in selected department appear

6️⃣ Student Database Page

Purpose: Display all students dynamically

Features:

Filter:

Department (dropdown from DepartmentService)

Section (filtered based on department)

Year / Semester

Table Columns: Name, Roll No, Dept, Section, Email, Phone, Photo

Action buttons: (Optional for now) Edit / Delete

Behavior:

Mock DB service handles adding, updating, deleting

Adding new department or section automatically updates filters

7️⃣ Entry Logs Page

Same as before

Filter logs by Department / Section / Student / Date

Logs automatically link student → department → section

8️⃣ Services / Mock DB

We now need 4 services for dynamic data:

DepartmentService

departments = [{ id: 'CS', name: 'Computer Science' }]
addDepartment(depObj)
getDepartments()


SectionService

sections = [{ id: 'A', name: 'A', departmentId: 'CS' }]
addSection(secObj)
getSectionsByDepartment(depId)


StudentService

students = [{ id: 'S001', name: 'Ali', department: 'CS', section: 'A', ... }]
addStudent(studentObj)
getStudentsByFilter(dep?, sec?, year?, semester?)
validateStudent(studentObj)  // check if allowed to login in student app


EntryLogService

logs = [{ studentId: 'S001', time: '2026-01-20T09:00', status: 'Login Successful' }]
addLog(logObj)
getLogsByFilter(dep?, sec?, studentId?, date?)


Notes:

Use local storage / in-memory arrays for now

Simulate async behavior with Promises or Observables

Later, replace with real API calls

9️⃣ Integration with Student App

Student app validates input against dynamic mock DB

Only registered students (with correct dept/section) can login → generate QR → logs created

✅ Key Advantages

Fully relational & scalable

New departments/sections automatically appear in dropdowns

Student database is dynamic and filterable

Easy to integrate with backend later
